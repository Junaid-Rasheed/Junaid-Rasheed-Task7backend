This backend code provides comprehensive functionality for server-side pagination, filtration, and sorting. It's designed to seamlessly handle large datasets efficiently. The code is built using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB Atlas serving as the backend database solution.

To get started with this backend:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the command `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Once the dependencies are installed, start the server by running `node app.js`.

With the server up and running, it's ready to handle requests from client-side applications, offering robust features like pagination, filtration based on various fields (such as name, age, email, and date of birth), and sorting capabilities.
